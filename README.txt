This Java Spring Boot Application calculates the valid SETs from all the cards provided in input.

To Run This:
1. Open the project in an IDEA(IntelliJ, Eclipse etc).
2. Drop the input file in  the /src/main/resources folder. (*Note: input.txt and input2.txt are already placed there in case you want to run these as an example)
3. Provide the file name to be treated as input in the Program Arguments of your run/debug configuration:
4. "Run" the code using your IDEA.
5. Console will print the information in desired format.

** Note : The main logic resides in the class : GameLogic.java
** Note : I have tried to create a proper application, hence the elaborate service, model structure in the app. I have tried to use ENUMS and proper POJOs(models) as well wherever applicable.

Hope this code runs perfectly fine for you. Please contact me if it doesn't.
Really hoping to hear back from you.
